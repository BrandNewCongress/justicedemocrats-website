Why not just start a new party?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>The two-party paradigm is the model for our country’s current political system. While we agree with and often champion many third-party candidates and movements, the reality is that right now it is next to impossible for a third-party candidate to win a national election.</p><p>We want our democracy to work for Americans again as soon as possible. The best way to do this is by working to change the Democratic party from the inside out. In the future, when we’ve established a progressive congress, Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress intend to work to change the two-party system and our election system as a whole.</p></div><a name="q1_2"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">How are you different from these other Democratic groups such as Brand New Congress and Our Revolution?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>We are thrilled that so many new organizations have come forward to enact change. Some groups, such as Our Revolution are focusing on local and state elections. Justice Democrats together with partner Brand New Congress, are focused solely on the congressional races for 2018.</p></div><a name="q1_3"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Who is running Justice Democrats? Who are the major players?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>Justice Democrats was created by Cenk Uygar, CEO of The Young Turks, and Zack Exley and Saikat Chakrabarti. Zack and Saikat are former Bernie Sanders campaign staffers and current members of the <a href="https://www.brandnewcongress.org" target="_blank">Brand New Congress</a> team.</p></div><a name="q1_4"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">What is the relationship between Justice Democrats and The Young Turks?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>The CEO of The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur is one of the founders of Justice Democrats. The Young Turks Network has been calling for a truly progressive Democratic party for several years. Justice Democrats was founded with a practical mission to rebuild the Democratic party and run corruption-free Democratic congressional campaigns that lead to a progressive and unbought congress in 2018. Donations given to Justice Democrats are entirely separate from funding raised by The Young Turks and will be strictly used toward the Justice Democrats mission.</p></div><a name="q1_5"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">What is the relationship between Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>Electing hundreds of candidates to rebuild a broken Democratic Party is not a small task. If we want to pull the party away from corporate control, we need allies -- as many as we can get.</p><p>That's why we were excited to team up with <a href="https://www.brandnewcongress.org" target="_blank">Brand New Congress</a> -- a project to recruit, vet and run hundreds of people-powered candidates in 2018. Where we share common ground, we'll work together on recruiting, vetting, and supporting strong progressive candidates for Congress.</p></div><br><br><!-- Category --><h2 class="faqCategory">About the Candidates</h2><a name="q2_1"></a><p class="faqQuestion">Who will the candidates be?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>Please check out the detailed description of who we are looking for at the top of our <a href="/Nominate">candidate nomination form</a>.

Are you going to run against them?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>We won’t run against candidates that fully support the Justice Democrats platform. We believe many current members of Congress will support this plan, and we expect that as the campaign becomes stronger, more and more members of Congress will endorse our platform.</p></div><br><br><!-- Category --><h2 class="faqCategory">Platform</h2><a name="q3_1"></a><p class="faqQuestion">What is your platform?

PAC is a term that was created to help with campaign finance reform and any group that raises contributions for federal elections must register as a PAC. Our type of PAC is the most basic, transparent kind of political organization. There are no anonymous or unlimited donations. Our donors are limited by the standard donation limits. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee" target="_blank">Corporations and unions are prohibited</a> from donating to our campaign.</p></div><a name="q4_2"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Do you have a dollar amount cap on donations from any one individual?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>Yes, it is the federal limit of $5,000.</p></div><a name="q4_3"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Do you accept Dark Money? Will you be disclosing all donations?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>Our designation as a Federal PAC does not allow us to receive anonymous or unlimited donations. Not only are we required by law to disclose all donors, but our platform is fundamentally opposed to corporate influence in American elections and pay-to-play politics in any form.</p></div><a name="q4_4"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Who are the major funders?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>The American people, with an average donation of $18.</p></div><a name="q4_5"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Will The Young Turks receive any percentage of Justice Democrats donations?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>No, 100% of donations will be used to build and run congressional campaigns.</p></div><a name="q4_6"></a><hr><p class="faqQuestion">Where can I go to see a list of your donors?</p><div class="faqAnswer"><p>The Federal Election Committee posts all campaign filings pubicly so you will be able (after the first filing is made) to <a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml" target="_blank">review donor information here</a>.</p></div><br><br><!-- Category --><h2 class="faqCategory">Your Part</h2><a name="q5_1"></a><p class="faqQuestion">I don’t have a lot of money.
