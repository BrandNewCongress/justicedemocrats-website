<p class="pullout pulloutYellow">We are recruiting incredible people to run for Congress in 2018 in a unified campaign behind a single plan to fix our government and our country.</p>
<h3>Justice Democrats are</h3>
<p>Selfless leaders from all walks of life and all areas of our economy and society, representing every community. We want a Congress that looks like America (and America does not look like a bunch of wealthy lawyers).</p>
<p>
    <br>
</p>
<h3>WE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Are respected in their communities with a track record of service in their jobs, neighborhoods, religious organizations, charities, etc.</li>
    <li>Have a history that shows they won&rsquo;t sell out in DC, because many of their life choices have put others in front of their self interest</li>
    <li>Agree with the Justice Democrats platform. They need to believe that America already has everything it needs to fix our economy, our healthcare system, our schools and our justice system &mdash; and that we can just do it if we have people in office who aren&rsquo;t just catering to corporations</li>
    <li>Will be strong fighters who will fight for big change and will not buckle under pressure</li>
    <li>Are non-dogmatic, optimistic people who believe the American people can build our country by working together</li>
    <li>Do not have any disdain or condescension for any group of Americans and have a high level of empathy</li>
    <li>Are good at what they do</li>
    <li>Are trusted by the people they currently serve</li>
    <li>Are not people who have spent a life in politics for the sake of advancing their own position</li>
    <li>Are ideally someone involved in doing work that actually keeps our country going: nurses, teachers, engineers, workers, moms and dads, social workers, veterans, law enforcement, first responders, managers, etc.</li>
    <li>Have the skills that would make them good candidates against experienced incumbents &mdash; they&rsquo;ve got to be able to talk, and to develop a grasp of all the major issues affecting their district</li>
    <li>Represent their district and will be someone people in their district can relate to and trust</li>
</ul>
